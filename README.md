# PythonTicTacToe
This assignment challenges you to apply your knowledge of dictionaries to create a fun tic-tac-toe game in Python!

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a space on a 3x3 grid with their symbol (X or O). The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

Your Task:
1.	Imagine the tic-tac-toe grid as a dictionary. Each key in the dictionary will represent a position on the board. The corresponding value will represent the symbol occupying that position (initially empty or marked by X or O).

2.	Use the dictionary to keep track of the current state of the game board. As players make moves, update the dictionary values to reflect their marks.

3.	Display the current state of the game board on the screen using the information stored in the dictionary. This will help players visualize the gameâ€™s progress.

4.	Allow players to choose their moves by entering the position they want to mark.

5.	After each move, implement logic to check if either player has achieved three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) using the dictionary values. Declare the winner or indicate a tie if the board is full.
